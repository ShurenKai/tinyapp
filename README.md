#Welcome to the tinyURL app created by Cassie/Ren Chen!#

##In order for all of this madness to work, I needed to download the following dependencies:##
* "bcryptjs" version 2.4.3,
* "body-parser" version 1.19.0,
* "cookie-session" version 1.4.0,
* "ejs" version 3.1.6,
* "express" version 4.17.1,
* "method-override" version 3.0.0

You can download all of these with a simple ``` npm install ``` command!
Once that is done, you may use the command ```node express_server``` to see what's going on :3c
(that is the ```express_server.js``` file)

#####When you register, you realize that you have a new urls page, listing all of your URLs. So far, we've created none but that's soon to change.#####

#####And voila! You've made a URL that is so much shorter than it's original! If you clicked the tinyURL link itself, it'll redirect you to wherever you need to go.#####
