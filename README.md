Welcome to the tinyURL app created by Cassie/Ren Chen!

Oh, I see that you're not logged in or registered. Well, don't worry, if you click the sentence, you can see that it'll redirect you to the registration page

Register yourself in order to access anything within this app, this screenshot only shows the change in the page, everything else is roughly the same :D

When you register, you realize that you have a new urls page, listing all of your URLs. So far, we've created none but that's soon to change.

And voila! You've made a URL that is so much shorter than it's original! If you clicked the tinyURL link itself, it'll redirect you to wherever you need to go

Thank you for registering and may your links be very small
